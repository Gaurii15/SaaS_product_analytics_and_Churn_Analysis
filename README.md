### 2️⃣ Data Merging
- Combined datasets using `account_id`  
- Created master dataset (~147K rows)  

---

### 3️⃣ Feature Engineering (Core Step)
- Transformed event-level data → customer-level dataset  
- Created features:
  - Total feature usage  
  - Average usage duration  
  - Total errors  
  - Total tickets  
  - Customer satisfaction  
  - ARR & MRR  

➡️ Final dataset: **500 × 20**
